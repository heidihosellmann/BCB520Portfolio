HM1-6 were fed human milk for 28 days in our lab. IF1-6 were fed infant formula for 28 days in our lab.

One of these columns = “Pigs” and specifies the observations described above. All other variables are cytokine values from ELISAs on various intestinal tissues harvested fromt the pigs at necropsy on DOL 28 (except HM/IF5- they had to stay with us a little longer).
