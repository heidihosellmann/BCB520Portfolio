    "text": "EXPANDED SCATTERPLOT\nThe data from the most recent drafts aren’t really helpful for our question. Let’s go back in time and use a draft year that has had some time to develop and reach their potential. How about 2018?\n\nCodedraft2018&lt;-NHLDraft%&gt;%\n  filter(draftyear==2018 & postdraft&lt;6) \n\n# wondering why I've filtered postdraft to be less than 6?  Try removing that filter to see what happens.\n\nggplot(draft2018, aes(x=round, y=NHLgames))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nHmmm… in addition to the problem of overplotting, we’ve got an additional issue here. We actually have two keys and one attribute. The attribute is NHLgames, and the keys are round and postdraft, but we are only using round.\nPostdraft indicates the number of seasons after being drafted. We have several choices here. We can make a visualization that uses both keys, or we can somehow summarize the data for one of the keys.\nFor example, let’s say we just wanted to know the TOTAL number of NHL games played since being drafted.\n\nCodedrafttot2018&lt;- draft2018%&gt;%\n  group_by(playerId, round, overall, position, name)%&gt;%\n  summarise(totgames=sum(NHLgames))\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'playerId', 'round', 'overall', 'position'.\nYou can override using the `.groups` argument.\n\nCodeggplot(drafttot2018, aes(x=round, y=totgames))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nLook closely at the two graphs above. How are they different?"
