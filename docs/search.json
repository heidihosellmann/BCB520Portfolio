As round picks increase, those players often play less NHL games.\nThere are few things wrong with this visualization, however:\n\n\nOverplotting. All those points on the y=0 line represent about 32 players each.

We have several choices here.

How are they different?\nHmm… it looks like this graph has accounted for/ordered other attributes. I am not sure exactly how though. I just notice in the code that we have grouped by different variables- perhaps this is what makes the second graph seem a bit more ordered?\nI also noticed that we came up with “totgames” as a sum of “NHLgames”. So if I am following, totgames = sum of NHL games played as ordered by those previous variables (playerId, round, overall, position, name)?"

I set up the original data frame to conform to the tidy data principles (every column is a variable, every row is an observation), which is pretty much the base form of how we’ve discussed Tabular Data in class.\nI’ve snuck in some functions that have allowed me to FILTER, GROUP, and SUMMARIZE the data, often creating new dataframes as I do so. Hey, look! A handy cheatsheet for data transformation using the tidyverse!\nThese functions come from the dplyr package that gets installed as part of the tidyverse. The basic categories of actions are:\n\nmutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables\nselect() picks variables based on their names.\nfilter() picks cases based on their values.\nsummarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary.\narrange() changes the ordering of the rows.\n\nAll of these work with group_by() so you can perform whichever operation on the groups that might be present in your data set.\nOk- so earlier we group_by() and did summarise() within that.\nLet’s get back to improving our understanding of the relative value of NHL draft picks. The figure above considers a single draft class (2018), and shows the total number of NHL games all the players have accumulated, separating each draft round on an ordinal x axis.\nGot it!\nFine, I guess, but we still have to deal with overplotting, and think about whether a scatterplot really helps us accomplish our task.

We’ll cover other potential solutions (such as box plots and violin plots) to this issue later in the course, when we get to the notions of faceting and data reduction.\nWhy not include all the data? A scatter plot with that many players (4775) isn’t going to be great. But we could plot some sort of polynomial model to get a sense of the relationship between draft position and NHL games.

    "text": "SCENARIO\nImagine you are a high priced data science consultant. One of your good friends, Cassandra Canuck, is an Assistant General Manager for the Vancouver Canucks, a team in the National Hockey League with a long, long…. long history of futility.\nThis season feels different.\nThe Canucks are currently among the league leaders and appear to be on their way to their first playoff appearance in many years. A few weeks ago, the Vancouver Canucks decided to trade an underperforming player with a high upside and their first round draft pick to the Calgary Flames for Elias Lindholm, a very solid forward that might prove to be the missing piece of their Stanley Cup puzzle. Exciting!\nExcept that now the Canucks are struggling. They’ve lost 4 straight games and have seemingly lost their identity as a team. The fans are questioning whether the trade was worth it. Woe is me!\nFor the purposes of this exercise, let’s set the 2024 NHL draft order using the Tankathon Simulator. The NHL uses a lottery system in which the teams lowest in the standings have the highest odds of getting the first overall pick. This year the Canucks are at the top of the league, and positioned to have the 31st overall pick. According to the simulator, Calgary will pick at number 2 (which is very valuable!), and the Canuck’s pick at 31.\nHere is a screenshot:\n\n\nHere is the question:\nWas the trade worth it? This trade has a high likelihood of becoming what we call a rental. Elias Lindholm is on an expiring contract, meaning Vancouver is guaranteed to hold his contract only through the end of the season. They might be able to extend him, but that depends on the salary cap.\nMeanwhile, Calgary can draft a player at position 31, who may or may not turn out to be of equal or greater value than Lindholm.\nWas the trade worth it? Did Vancouver or Calgary “win” the trade?\nCan we make some visualizations that help us answer this question?\nHere is an article on modeling draft pick value!\nOriginal analysis!\nEric Tulsky’s original paper*"

One approach is to look at the historical performance of players from various draft positions.\nI’ve created a data set that will allow us to explore player performance as a function of draft position. If you are curious as to how I obtained and re-arranged these data, you can check out that tutorial here. For this assignment, though, I want to focus on the visualizations.\n\n\nCode\nNHLDraft&lt;-read.csv(\"NHLDraft.csv\")\nNHLDictionary&lt;-read_excel(\"NHLDictionary.xlsx\")\n\nknitr::kable(NHLDictionary)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAttribute\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ndraftyear\nOrdinal\nCalendar year in which the player was drafted into the NHL.\n\n\nname\nItem\nFull name of the player.\n\n\nround\nOrdinal\nRound in which the player was drafted (1 to 7).\n\n\noverall\nOrdinal\nOverall draft position of the player (1 to 224)\n\n\npickinRound\nOrdinal\nPosition in which the player was drafted in their round (1 to 32).\n\n\nheight\nQuantitative\nPlayer height in inches.\n\n\nweight\nQuantitative\nPlayer weight in pounds.\n\n\nposition\nCategorical\nPlayer position (Forward, Defense, Goaltender)\n\n\nplayerId\nItem\nUnique ID (key) assigned to each player.\n\n\npostdraft\nOrdinal\nNumber of seasons since being drafted (0 to 20).\n\n\nNHLgames\nQuantitative\nNumber of games played in the NHL in that particular season (regular season is 82 games, playoffs are up to 28 more).\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, we have a dataframe with all the drafted players from 2000-2018, their position, their draft year and position, and then rows for each season since being drafted (postdraft). The key variable here is NHLgames, which tells us how many games they played in the NHL each season since being drafted. Whether drafted players even make the NHL, and how many games they play, might be a good proxy to understand the value of a draft pick we just traded away."

Players get drafted when they are 18 years old, and they usually play in the juniors, minor leagues, or the NCAA for a bit to further develop.\nLet’s use a scatterplot to visualize this phenomenon with the most recent draft classes.\n\n\nCode\ndraft2022&lt;-NHLDraft%&gt;%\n  filter(draftyear==2022 & postdraft==0)\n\nggplot(draft2022, aes(x=round, y=NHLgames))+\n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\n\nAs you can see, the players drafted in June of 2022 didn’t play much last season.

That’s fine, but let’s think about the manipulations to the TABULAR DATA I’ve had to perform.\nI’m using the Tidyverse to do these manipulations. I set up the original data frame to conform to the tidy data principles (every column is a variable, every row is an observation), which is pretty much the base form of how we’ve discussed Tabular Data in class.\nI’ve snuck in some functions that have allowed me to FILTER, GROUP, and SUMMARIZE the data, often creating new dataframes as I do so. Hey, look! A handy cheatsheet for data transformation using the tidyverse!\nThese functions come from the dplyr package that gets installed as part of the tidyverse. The basic categories of actions are:\n\nmutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables\nselect() picks variables based on their names.\nfilter() picks cases based on their values.\nsummarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary.\narrange() changes the ordering of the rows.\n\nAll of these work with group_by() so you can perform whichever operation on the groups that might be present in your data set.\nLet’s get back to improving our understanding of the relative value of NHL draft picks. The figure above considers a single draft class (2018), and shows the total number of NHL games all the players have accumulated, separating each draft round on an ordinal x axis.\nFine, I guess, but we still have to deal with overplotting, and think about whether a scatterplot really helps us accomplish our task. For this figure do the following:\n\nOverplotting. All those points on the y=0 line represent about 32 players each. Can you you think of a way that adding extra channels might help?\nLabelling.
