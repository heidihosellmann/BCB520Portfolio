P1 and P2 were pilot pigs fed piglet milk replacer formula. C1 and C2 were farm control pigs (siblings) raised at a farm (the same one as the other pigs), feeding from their own mom, and then we received them for necropsy on day of life (DOL) 28. HM1-6 were fed human milk for 28 days in our lab. IF1-6 were fed infant formula for 28 days in our lab.

One of these columns = “Pigs” and specifies the observations described above. All other variables are cytokine values from ELISAs on various intestinal tissues harvested fromt the pigs at necropsy on DOL 28 (except HM/IF5- they had to stay with us a little longer). Detected ELISAs tested included IL1B, TNFA, and IL8. Each of these cytokines were tested on the jejunum (Jej), ileum (Ile), and Colon (Col) of each pig.

    "text": "SIMPLE SCATTERPLOT\nJust like many pro sports, it is pretty rare for a player to play in the NHL right after being drafted. Players get drafted when they are 18 years old, and they usually play in the juniors, minor leagues, or the NCAA to further develop.\nLet’s use a scatterplot to visualize this phenomenon with the most recent draft classes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. Scatterplot depicting number of NHL games played after being drafted from various rounds during the year of 2022.\nMARKS = Points\nCHANNELS = Position\nKEY-VALUE PAIRS = Only values of round pick number and games played in the NHL.\nOk so this scatterplot shows that 1st round picks play the most NHL games, at least those drafted in June 2022. As round picks increase, those players often play less NHL games.\nThere are few things wrong with this visualization, however:\n\n\nOverplotting. All those points on the y=0 line represent about 32 players each. Can you think of a way that adding extra channels might help?\n\nHmm… jitter?\n\n\n\n\n\nI added an additional channel/key of jitter reflecting picks in round and color showing the spectrum of picks in round… Not sure how helpful this is, but I tried!\n\n\nLabeling. Can we create a solid figure caption and better axis labels for this figure? In your caption, please specify the task(s) the visualization is intended to facilitate, as well as the marks, channels, and key-value pairs used.\n\n(I added these above)\n\n\nKey-Value pairs: Looks like we are using “round” as a continuous variable. Can we change this to an ordered factor?\n\nHmm… I am not sure. Use/add in additional/other variables, perhaps?"

    "text": "EXPANDED SCATTERPLOT\nThe data from the most recent drafts aren’t really helpful for our question. Let’s go back in time and use a draft year that has had some time to develop and reach their potential. How about 2018?\n\n\n\n\n\nHmmm… in addition to the problem of overplotting, we’ve got an additional issue here. We actually have two keys and one attribute. The attribute is NHLgames, and the keys are round and postdraft, but we are only using round.\n… explicitly, right? Of note, we filtered by only using the draft year of 2018 and included NHL games played up to 6 years from that draft (so 2024 if I did my math right). This makes sense- we are in the year 2024!\nAs I just touched on above, postdraft indicates the number of seasons after being drafted. We have several choices here. We can make a visualization that uses both keys, or we can somehow summarize the data for one of the keys.\nAlrighty, sounds good to me.\nFor example, let’s say we just wanted to know the TOTAL number of NHL games played since being drafted. We will make it a new variable!\n\n\n\n\n\nLook closely at the two graphs above. How are they different?\nHmm… it looks like this graph has accounted for/ordered other attributes. I am not sure exactly how though. I just notice in the code that we have grouped by playerId, round, overall, position, and name… Perhaps this is what makes the second graph seem a bit more ordered?\nFurther, we also came up with “totgames” as a sum of “NHLgames”. So if I am following, totgames = sum of NHL games played as ordered by those previous variables (playerId, round, overall, position, name)?"

    "text": "STOP AND REFLECT\nWe need to think about how Barrie has been manipulating the data…\nHe says: I’m using the Tidyverse to do these manipulations. I set up the original data frame to conform to the tidy data principles (every column is a variable, every row is an observation), which is pretty much the base form of how we’ve discussed Tabular Data in class.\nI’ve snuck in some functions that have allowed me to FILTER, GROUP, and SUMMARIZE the data, often creating new dataframes as I do so. Hey, look! A handy cheatsheet for data transformation using the tidyverse!\nThese functions come from the dplyr package that gets installed as part of the tidyverse. The basic categories of actions are:\n\nmutate() adds new variables that are functions of existing variables\nselect() picks variables based on their names.\nfilter() picks cases based on their values.\nsummarise() reduces multiple values down to a single summary.\narrange() changes the ordering of the rows.\n\nAll of these work with group_by() so you can perform whichever operation on the groups that might be present in your data set.\nOk great… I am starting to get the lingo. Earlier we did group_by() and summarise().\nLet’s get back to improving our understanding of the relative value of NHL draft picks. The figure above considers a single draft class (2018), and shows the total number of NHL games all the players have accumulated, separating each draft round on an ordinal x axis.\nGot it!\nFine, I guess, but we still have to deal with overplotting, and think about whether a scatterplot really helps us accomplish our task."

    "text": "SCATTERPLOT WITH OVERALL DRAFT POSITION\nThis approach might yield a better match with the scatterplot idiom. What if we ignore draft round, and use the player’s overall draft position instead? It also might help us focus on our motivating question! What is the potential value of pick 31, and how does Elias Lindholm compare to that value?\nYes! We want to apply these manipulations to get a better feel for this 31st pick. And looking at this as a function of NHL games played.\n\n\n\n\n\nI took the liberty of zooming in the x axis to 0-50. After all, Elias was a 31st round pick! This allows us to see how many games other typical 31-ish picks play (at least from the 2018 draft year)."

    "text": "SCATTERPLOT SUMMARY\nWe seem to be running into an issue in terms of overplotting. Scatterplots are great, but they work best for two quantitative attributes, and we have a situation with one or two keys and one quantitative attribute. The thing is, scatterplots can be very useful when part of our workflow involves modeling the data in some way. We’ll cover this kind of thing in future assignments, but just a bit of foreshadowing here:\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding the smoothed line doesn’t eliminate the overplotting problem, but it does indicate that it exists. We’ll cover other potential solutions (such as box plots and violin plots) to this issue later in the course, when we get to the notions of faceting and data reduction.\nWhy not include all the data? A scatter plot with that many players (4775) isn’t going to be great. But we could plot some sort of polynomial model to get a sense of the relationship between draft position and NHL games. We’ll filter to the first 8 years of their career.\nSounds good to me!\n\n\n\n\n\nOr we could visualize the average number of games played as a function of time since being drafted.\n\n\n\n\n\nI personally really like this figure. And in class we manipulated it to better answer the question of if the trade was a good trade.\nI am going to try to recreate a version of sorts of this figure above for my CONCLUSIVE FIGURE. In doing so, I will try to get back to the point of this assignment in the first place.\nI want to compare Elias himself (who’s draft data from 2013 is in the dataset) to other good players (measured by their round picked, but position specific). On the y axis, I don’t want to just look at games played, but the performance within those games. The variable “points” will be used to do this as it summarizes goals and assists- valuable player performance stats indeed, at least I would guess so for a forward!\n(As Barrie’s original hint eluded to, I am going to use the NHLdraftstats.csvdata to gather these performance measures.)\n\n\n[1] \"C:/Users/heidi/OneDrive - University of Idaho/UI Spring 2024/BCB 520 Data Vis/BCB520Portfolio/posts/Assignment 5 NHL Draft Analysis\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n…1\ndraftyear\nname\nround\noverall\npickinRound\nheight\nweight\nposition\nplayerId\npostdraft\nNHLgames\ngoals\nassists\npoints\n\n\n\n54811\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n10\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n54812\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n11\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n54813\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n12\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n54814\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n13\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n54815\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n2\n82\n11\n28\n39\n\n\n54816\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n3\n72\n11\n34\n45\n\n\n54817\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n5\n81\n27\n51\n78\n\n\n54818\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n6\n70\n29\n25\n54\n\n\n54819\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n7\n56\n19\n28\n47\n\n\n54820\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n8\n82\n42\n40\n82\n\n\n54821\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n9\n64\n18\n35\n53\n\n\n54822\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n1\n81\n17\n22\n39\n\n\n54823\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n4\n81\n16\n28\n44\n\n\n54824\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n14\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n54825\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n0\n58\n9\n12\n21\n\n\n54826\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n15\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n54827\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n16\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n54828\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n17\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n54829\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n18\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n54830\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n19\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n54831\n2013\nElias Lindholm\n1\n5\n5\n72\n192\nForward\n8477496\n20\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n\n\n\n\nNow I want to look at a graph that looks at points scored over the seasons following being drafted.
