Well, in\nthis workup, I will evaluate how the University of Idaho compares to\nneighboring institutions in terms of grants awarded and productivity\nfrom those awards.\n\nI will be evaluating award/grant data from four federal sponsors: The\nNational Science Foundation (NSF), The National Institutes of Health\n(NIH), The Department of Energy (DOE), and The US Department of\nAgriculture (USDA).\n\nWhy is the question or purpose important? We shall find out!\n\n# DATA\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n**1. Department of Agriculture (NIFA)** A snippet of the awards from\nUSDA pertaining to UI are included below.

This is most likely not the\ncase, so the orange line should be interpreted with caution. In general,\nthe USDA actually seems to be on the decline, which would be concerning\ngiven the type of school the University of Idaho is. As for the DOE, it\nseems we are on the rise during the past couple years. The NSF seems to\nbe steady at the moment. Meanwhile, the NIH does not have much history\nof giving new grants to the UI in the past 10 years, but hopefully being\non the board will start the ball rolling again.\n\n# QUESTION 3\n\n*How is UI performing with these sponsors when compared to the following\npeer institutions: Boise State University,* *Idaho State University,*\n*Montana State University,* *University of Montana, and* *Washington\nState University?*\n\n*Note that “performing” can mean a variety of different things.

Although not complex, these performance attributes capture\nimportant metrics nonetheless.\n\nThe limitations of this figure are first and foremost that it only\naddresses grants from the NIH and NSF, not the USDA and DOE. I chose to\ndo this out of sake for convenience. Also, for the NIH, this time I\nadded the indirect and direct costs to compute the award amount (in\nFigure 1., I only used direct cost). Further, because of the discrepant\ndata sources, some of the institutions have multiple locations also\nshown in this figure. Although I could agglomerate the data so each\ninstitution has one reference point, I actually think this may be\ninsightful to see how the smaller institutions compare to the larger\nones.\n\nAll in all, from this figure, we can see the U of I compares well in the\nrealm of NSF grants. This is not so much the case for the NIH grants.\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nIn conclusion, this stuff is messy indeed! Throughout my three main\nvisualizations, I found out what active grants the U of I has and how\nthose compare across sponsors. I then expanded that information to\ncompare specific sponsors to various other schools nearby. In general,\nwe need more DOE and NIH work to be done. USDA and NSF are doing well,\nbut we want to get back on the rise again (at least with the USDA).\n\nI realized through this work that, as Barrie has alluded to, it indeed\ndoes take a lot of time going through these different data and finding\nwhat is similar/comparable and cleaning those aspects of the data in\norder to put visualizations together.\n\nI think it would be interesting to continue to explore and see how the U\nof I compares to other institutions with the other sponsors, and I\nwonder how data scientists wrap their heads around all these details!\n\n# APPENDIX\n\n## Data Dictionary\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {#fig-USDAtoUIDataDict .cell-output-display}\n|Attribute         |Description                                           |Type         |\n|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|:------------|\n|Award Date        |Date when award was granted                           |Ordinal      |\n|Grant Number      |Unique ID for each grant                              |Item         |\n|Proposal Number   |N/A for all                                           |NA           |\n|Grant Title       |N/A for all                                           |NA           |\n|State Name        |State of award (all = IDAHO)                          |Categorical  |\n|Grantee Name      |Tells who received the grant (all = U of I)           |Categorical  |\n|Award Dollars     |Award amount                                          |Quantitative |\n|Program Name      |Name of program grant will be used for (some are N/A) |Categorical  |\n|Program Area Name |Name of program (some have N/A)                       |Categorical  |\n\n\n\nUSDAtoUI Data Dictionary\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {#fig-DOEDataDict .cell-output-display}\n|Attribute              |Description                                                                                                                                   |Type...3     |...4 |...5 |...6 |Type...7     |\n|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|:----|:----|:----|:------------|\n|Award Number           |ID of award                                                                                                                                   |Item         |NA   |NA   |NA   |Ordinal      |\n|Title                  |Title of award                                                                                                                                |Item         |NA   |NA   |NA   |Item         |\n|Institution            |Organization to whom award was granted.
