Department of Agriculture (NIFA)** See the data dictionary here\n@fig-USDAtoUIDataDict. This includes agricultural related grants all the\nway from the early 2000s.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n**2. Department of Energy (DOE)** The data dictionary for this extensive data set can be accessed here\n@fig-DOEDataDict. This data is not restricted to a particular award\nrecipient.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n**3. National Institutes of Health (NIH)** This data can be obtained\nfrom an Application Programming Interface (API). You can access this data's dictionary here @fig-project_dfDataDict. This\nis quite a large data set with information on awards (related to health\nsciences) recieved by BSU and U of I between 2013-2024. Of note, this is\nan example of heirarchal data- some cells appear to have no values in\nthem becuase there are actually multiple variables within those cells.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n**4. National Science Foundation (NSF)** The NSF also has an API, and\nthe following code pulled down awards to the University of Idaho into a\ndata frame called NSFtoUI. See the data dictionary here @fig-NSFtoUIDataDict. Briefly, this data\nset gives information on NSF grants awarded to the University of Idaho\nfrom 1975 to current day.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n# QUESTION 1\n\n*Provide a visualization that shows our active awards from each sponsor.\nI need to see their start date and end date, the amount of the award,\nand the name of the Principal Investigator. I’m really interested in\nseeing how far into the future our current portfolio will exist. Are\nthere a bunch of awards about to expire? Are there a bunch that just got\nfunded and will be active for a while? Does this vary across sponsors?*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nI am going to manipulate and make new data sets for all\nsponsors. Then I will combine them all and plot a summary figure.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Putting all the active awards from various sponsors together\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n![Question1Visualization](question1plot.png)\n\n**Figure 3.** This figure shows U of I PI last names and their active grants they have received as of 2017. The bars are colored by sponsor and the text amount signifies the amount they have received for said award. The USDA data is not included due to a lack of necessary variables. The strengths of this figure is that it displays, rather than over plots, PIs who have multiple awards. Limitations are that this figure only includes grants that have started in 2017 and on. \n\n# QUESTION 2\n\n*What is the proportional representation of new awards to the UI from\nthese various sources over the past 5 to 10 years? Are there any trends\nthat are encouraging or discouraging?*\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Putting all the sponsors together\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Assignment-6-Midterm_files/figure-html/Visualizing all sponsors-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Figure 5.** This figure shows the approximate trends of new grants received by the\nUniversity of Idaho from various sponsors in the last 10 years.\n\nLimitations include that the USDA data set did not have specifications\ndenoting whether the awards were new or continuing, therefore, I was\nonly able to go off the award date for being in the last 10 years and\nhad to make the assumption all were new. This is most likely not the\ncase, so the orange line should be interpreted with caution. In general,\nthe USDA actually seems to be on the decline, which would be concerning\ngiven the type of school the University of Idaho is. As for the DOE, it\nseems we are on the rise during the past couple years. The NSF seems to\nbe steady at the moment. Meanwhile, the NIH data was interesting. Upon updating this document, grants considered \"new\" a week previously were not considered \"new\" anymore. Therefore, I just included all grants from the past 10 years. All in all, this is an interesting figure to address general trends within the last decade. \n\n# QUESTION 3\n\n*How is UI performing with these sponsors when compared to the following\npeer institutions: Boise State University,* *Idaho State University,*\n*Montana State University,* *University of Montana, and* *Washington\nState University?*\n\n*Note that “performing” can mean a variety of different things. You must\nchoose your metrics of performance and justify them.*\n\nI am going to use the API sources for\nthis question (NIH and NSF) by manipulating the API addresses and then manipulating the data. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n## Combining NIH and NSF for neighboring schools\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Assignment-6-Midterm_files/figure-html/Visualizing all the schools from NIH and NSF-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Figure 6.** This figure shows the award amounts of the active grants of each\ninstitution (and their various locations) sponsored by the NIH (coral)\nand NSF (blue).\n\nI used the measures of active awards and their relative amounts from\nthese sponsors to address how the U of I compares to neighboring\ninstitutions. Although not complex, these performance attributes capture\nimportant metrics nonetheless.\n\nThe limitations of this figure are first and foremost that it only\naddresses grants from the NIH and NSF, not the USDA and DOE. I chose to\ndo this out of sake for convenience. Also, for the NIH, this time I\nadded the indirect and direct costs to compute the award amount (in\nFigure 1., I only used direct cost). Further, because of the discrepant\ndata sources, some of the institutions have multiple locations also\nshown in this figure. Although I could agglomerate the data so each\ninstitution has one reference point, I actually think this may be\ninsightful to see how the smaller institutions compare to the larger\nones. In general, I could clean this figure up to look a little nicer. \n\nAll in all, from this figure, we can see the U of I compares well in the\nrealm of NSF grants. This is not so much the case for the NIH grants.\n\n# SUMMARY\n\nIn conclusion, this stuff is messy indeed! Throughout my three main\nvisualizations, I found out what active grants the U of I has and how\nthose compare across sponsors. I then expanded that information to\ncompare specific sponsors to various other schools nearby. In general,\nwe need more DOE and NIH work to be done. USDA and NSF are doing well,\nbut we want to get back on the rise again (at least with the USDA).\n\nI realized through this work that, as Barrie has alluded to, it indeed\ndoes take a lot of time going through these different data and finding\nwhat is similar/comparable and cleaning those aspects of the data in\norder to put visualizations together. Further, I learned the hard way that **LESS IS MORE!** \n\nI think it would be interesting to continue to explore and see how the U\nof I compares to other institutions with the other sponsors, and I\nwonder how data scientists wrap their heads around all these details!\n\n# APPENDIX\n\n## Data Dictionary\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {#fig-USDAtoUIDataDict .cell-output-display}\n|Attribute         |Description                                           |Type         |\n|:-----------------|:-----------------------------------------------------|:------------|\n|Award Date        |Date when award was granted                           |Ordinal      |\n|Grant Number      |Unique ID for each grant                              |Item         |\n|Proposal Number   |N/A for all                                           |NA           |\n|Grant Title       |N/A for all                                           |NA           |\n|State Name        |State of award (all = IDAHO)                          |Categorical  |\n|Grantee Name      |Tells who received the grant (all = U of I)           |Categorical  |\n|Award Dollars     |Award amount                                          |Quantitative |\n|Program Name      |Name of program grant will be used for (some are N/A) |Categorical  |\n|Program Area Name |Name of program (some have N/A)                       |Categorical  |\n\n\n\nUSDAtoUI Data Dictionary\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {#fig-DOEDataDict .cell-output-display}\n|Attribute              |Description                                                                                                                                   |Type...3     |...4 |...5 |...6 |Type...7     |\n|:----------------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:------------|:----|:----|:----|:------------|\n|Award Number           |ID of award                                                                                                                                   |Item         |NA   |NA   |NA   |Ordinal      |\n|Title                  |Title of award                                                                                                                                |Item         |NA   |NA   |NA   |Item         |\n|Institution            |Organization to whom award was granted.
